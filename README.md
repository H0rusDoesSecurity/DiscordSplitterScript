# DiscordSplitterScript
Helps you split your wall of text into Discord-input-limit sized chunks

## How to
* put the wall of text into a .txt file in the same folder as the script or .exe file
* run the script
* type in the file name
* start copy-pasting the output!

## My Windows Defender is complaining 
Yea, I have the same issue and I wrote the thing lol. The .exe might match some part of a virus signature in some way, but sadly there's not much I can do to fix it.
To use the program anyway,
* open Windows Security
* open Virus and Threat Protection
* open Protection History
* click on the arrow next to the DiscordSplitter entry
* choose the option to keep the file
